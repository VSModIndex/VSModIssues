# VSModIssues
Tracking issues on mods that misbehave, e.g. malformed modinfo.json.

Here, we track information about mods that misbehave. This primarily arises from zip/modinfo.json missing fields or having incorrect/unexpected values. This is because the official Vintage Story Mods DB doesn't have strict enforcement of uploaded zips or their contents. As a result, any program that attempts to manage dependencies must handle the various misbehaviors, or someone must put pressure on the mod authors to fix their mods.

Please see the issues: https://github.com/VSModIndex/VSModIssues/issues
